This file contains release notes for version 0.91 of Wood.New features since 0.9----------------------None. This release fixes a bug that made it not work to use a value of T forthe descend arg to p-store.Mod Histories-------------persistent-heap.lisp;; 03/20/95 bill  %p-store checks for (eq descend :store-slots-again) before calling require-type.;;                  This is an optimization, not a bug fix.;;                %fill-load-function-object takes a new descend arg.;;                %p-store-internal & %p-store-lfun-vector call %fill-load-function-object with the new arg.;;                %p-store-internal lets %p-store-object-body do all the work with p-store-hash;;                  and with the :store-slots-again descend value.;;                %p-store-internal doesn't make its first call to %p-store-object-body if;;                  in forced descend mode and there is no load function.;;                %p-store-object-body now handles the :store-slots-again descend value.;;                  It is also more efficient w.r.t. lookups in the p-store-hash table.
