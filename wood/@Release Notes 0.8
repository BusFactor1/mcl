This file contains release notes for version 0.8 of Wood.New features since 0.6----------------------There is a garbage collector. See documentation for GC-PHEAP-FILE in"wood.doc".Wood now properly restores structure instances. Wood 0.6 was able toP-STORE one, but would error on an attempt to P-LOAD it.The version number (stored in the header of a persistent heap file) haschanged, and OPEN-PHEAP now checks for the correct version number.Files with the old version number will be automatically updated to thenew version. The reason for the change was a bug with symbols whosestorage crossed a block boundary. The old code overwwrote the 8 byteheader for the next block instead of using the second 8 bytes in theblock.Bug fixes---------btrees.lisp;;; 07/31/93 bill  %btree-insert-in-inner-node now goes out of line to;;;                %attempt-to-shift-left-inner-node & %attempt-to-shift-right-inner-node.;;;                %attempt-to-shift-right-inner-node is new code. I thought;;;                that I could get away with leaving it out, but I was wrong.;;; 03/29/93 bill  *forwarded-btree* in btree-find-leaf-node & dc-map-btree;;; 03/25/93 bill  %btree-split-inner-node - wrong page on one of the accessing-byte-array's;;;                Also, neglected to update last-middle-size when the parent entry went at the;;;                end of the new middle node. In this case, some of the copying was also extraneous. disk-cache-accessors.lisp;; 08/10/93 bill eval-when around requires of lapmacros & lispequ.disk-cache.lisp;; 03/27/93 bill with-open-disk-cacheload-wood.lisp;; 12/17/93 bill  Use "wood:wood;..." instead of "wood:..." to prevent;;                bogus default directories.;;                Add "version-control" to *wood-files*persistent-clos.lisp;; 10/25/93 bill  initialize-persistent-instancepersistent-heap.lisp;; 12/27/93 bill  export p-btree-count, p-hash-table-count, initialize-persistent-instance;; 12/17/93 bill  increment version number.
