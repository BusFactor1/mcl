This file contains release note for version 0.961 of Wood.Changes since 0.96------------------It now works to save and restore floats from MCL-PPC.Version 096 and earlier stored/loaded only the high 32bits of the float, missing 32 bits of mantissa. If youhave any databases generated with MCL-PPC containing floats,you'll need to regenerate them (unless you don't care about theloss of precision).MCL-PPC can now also load short floats from a database createdby MCL 2.0.x or 3.0.x. It converts them to double floats on loading,since that is the only kind of float that MCL-PPC supports.Mod Histories-------------disk-cache-accessors.lisp;; 09/19/96 bill The PPC version of %%load-pointer handles short floats now via %%load-short-float;; 09/18/96 bill Fix brain-damage in PPC versions of read-double-float and (setf read-double-float)load-wood.lisp;; 09/20/96 bill  The WOOD package definition mentions the imported symbols as symbols,;;                not strings, for versions of MCL that don't already include them (e.g. 3.9).wood.lisp;; 09/20/96 bill  resignal the error in the handler-case if not a wrong fasl version error
